# Introduction to Front End Development
Front end development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.

# What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

# What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.

# What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.
